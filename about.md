Whenever I've had a blog, I've called it The Salt-Box. It's a self-deprecating joke from <em>Great Expectations</em>, where Dickens's preposterous Uncle Pumblechook says, "Plenty of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if he's ready with his salt-box." 

I'm the assistant director of teaching & learning with technology at Northeastern University. Previously I worked in accreditation and academic operations at Woolf, as the director of research, instruction, technology at Trinity College (Hartford), and as a tenured professor of English at Central Connecticut State University. (Hence the Dickens joke.)

I'm currently fascinated by teaching and the challenges/opportunities of scale.

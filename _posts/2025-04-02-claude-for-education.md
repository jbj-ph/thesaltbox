title: Claude for Education
---

Today Anthropic announced [Claude for Education](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education), which introduces "Learning Mode" (which, in Projects, tends to offer guidance rather than answers, has some common templates, and a few other tricks). It also includes whole-campus access to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

Now, a product announcement isn't really enough to warrant me re-launching a blog, but there is this nugget:
>Northeastern University is collaborating as Anthropic's first university design partner. This trail-blazing initiative aims to transform teaching, research and business practices across Northeastern’s global university system. The partnership provides 50,000 students, faculty, and staff across 13 global campuses with seamless access to Claude. We’re working with Northeastern University to build best practices for AI integration in higher education, new AI-powered education tools, and frameworks for responsible AI adoption in educational settings.

> Northeastern was the first university in the U.S. to develop an entire academic plan — Northeastern 2025 — focused on AI and its implications for the future of learning. President Joseph E. Aoun, a thought leader in AI and higher education, authored “Robot-Proof,” the definitive book on the future of learning in an AI-driven world. A second edition, released by MIT Press in August 2024, further explores AI’s evolving role in education and the workforce.

Well! This is a major development, and so I thought maybe it's time to start paying attention in writing to the ways campus-wide access to LLMs impacts Academic Technologies work.
